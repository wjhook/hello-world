diving into development


Hello GitHub!


My name is Justin.  I'm here to learn and collaborate.  I know next to nothing.  I'm trying to learn about Front End Development because I'm financially unstable in an expensive city and I'm not going to be a victim. I'm going to change careers to provide for my family and follow a career path I've wanted to follow for years.
